# Pothole-Image-Classification
Potholes occur on many public roads across the globe and pose serious risks to travellers. Currently, pothole detection is being done through visual inspection by human experts. This process takes too long thus leaving most of these roads in jeopardy. Therefore, there is a need for an automated pothole detection system that can detect potholes in real-time. This paper proposes a convolution neural network that is trained from scratch with the main aim of classifying pothole images from non-pothole images. The proposed method takes coloured images and converts them to an array before being fed to a trained model. The model then predicts the class label. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall and f1 score. The results show that the model achieved an accuracy of 87%, precision of 0.81, recall of 0.96, and f1 score of 0.88.
